# AirBnB-SF-Price-Prediction
Helping hosts in San Francisco price their listing using historical data from October 2019 

Airbnb has grown and over the years and there are more hosts joining the platform looking to temporarily rent out their homes or apartments to guests. However, many face a problem of deciding what amount to charge per night based on their location, type of house/aparment, number of bedrooms, and even the time of year.

By creating models to accurately predict price, hopefully new hosts feel less overwhelmed and get peace of mind of how to price their listing.
